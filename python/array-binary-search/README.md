## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I divided the array from middle and becuse the array is sorted we check 
the number if its > or smaller than middle 
and keep change the startnhg while reach the middle if not it will getout from the loop and return -1

the  O(n)= 4+8n
